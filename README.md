# 📊 AdventureWorks Customer Segmentation & Sales Prediction

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project analyzes the AdventureWorks database to:
- Segment customers using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** and **K-Means clustering**.
- Predict future sales using machine learning models.
- Identify customers at risk of **churn**.
- Provide actionable insights for business growth.
- Prepare data for visualization in **Power BI**.

## 📌 Process
1. **Data Extraction:** Extracted data from the **AdventureWorks database**. [(AdventureWorks DB)](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/adventure-works)
2. **RFM Analysis:** Calculated **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary** values for customers.
3. **Clustering:** Used **K-Means** clustering to segment customers.
4. **Prediction:** Implemented models using **LazyPredict** for future sales forecasting.
5. **Visualization:** Data prepared for **Power BI Dashboard** (To be added in future updates).

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Identified **high-value frequent buyers**, **occasional big spenders**, and **low-value infrequent buyers**.
- Customers with higher frequency and spending tend to be more recent.
- Potential churn risks detected among low-recency, low-frequency customers.
- Future sales trends predicted using machine learning models.

## 📊 Future Enhancements
- ✅ Improve clustering with additional ML techniques.
- ✅ Enhance sales prediction accuracy.
- ⏳ Integrate **Power BI Dashboard** for visualization.
- ⏳ Deploy an interactive web application for business use.

## 📌 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, LazyPredict)
- **SQL** (AdventureWorks Database)
- **Power BI** (Upcoming Visualization)
